      description: '“These massive features, they don’t land every year: maybe every two years, maybe every three years. But when they do get added they really advance the language forward.”',
      article: 'When you look at the new features going into JavaScript each year through the ECMAScript standards process, it might not always seem that the language is making major changes. A lot of improvements are what TC39 co-chair and head of Bloomberg’s JavaScript Infrastructure and Tooling team Rob Palmer calls “paving the cowpath” — by building something you could already do with a tool or a framework into the language — or syntactic sugar, to make it easier to use an existing feature without making mistakes. “We see this iteration of tools, frameworks [and] patterns, and over time, we in the standards world start to pick out where the convergence has happened and we try to pave that cowpath, which has the effect of decreasing the complexity in the application stack. So the size of your Node modules directory decreases, because more of that functionality is provided by the language itself.” Taken with major developments like adding native async in 2017, those incremental features add up, Vercel’s TC39 delegate Justin Ridgewell told the New Stack. “Over a span of years, they add up to a lot of new APIs with new functionality that we’re adding very quickly and then while the smaller things are being added, we’re working on massive features.”',
